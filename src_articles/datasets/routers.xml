	<sentence idSentence=1>This was the worst wifi extender I've ever used, and I've tried many trying to get the best wifi extender I can.</sentence>
	<opinion>aspect="wifi extender" sentiment="worst" polarity="Positive" aspectClass="Others" type="explicit"</opinion>
	<sentence idSentence=2>The only reason this costs more than the better extenders like any of the netgear ones is because it has a touch screen and looks pretty.</sentence>
	<sentence idSentence=3>It isn't even dual band.</sentence>
	<sentence idSentence=4>Only 2.4ghz and it hardly receives a signal from your router and the signal it puts out is slow.</sentence>
	<sentence idSentence=5>I would recommend the netgear ac750 which works great receives your router signal great and is dual band 2.4 and 5ghz and it also has a feature called fast lane technology which puts bot signals together into one faster signal.</sentence>
	<sentence idSentence=6>The ac1200 is good to puts out a much faster signal than the ac750 and has fast lane tech as well but puts out up to 1200Mbps where the ac750 puts out up to 750Mbps but it depends on how much bandwidth you receive from your provider where you won't get 1200Mbps unless yoyour cable modem is capable.</sentence>
	<sentence idSentence=7>I also found that the ac1200 which costs approx $100 and the ac750 is around $75 but I notice the ac1200 seems a bit harder to catch a good signal but if it does it is a pretty awesome extender it even has a dual core processor in it.</sentence>
	<sentence idSentence=8>But all in all I would never go with amped wireless again.</sentence>
	<sentence idSentence=9>They're pretty with touch screens but suck in performance and cost around $120 and it isn't even dual band.</sentence>
	<sentence idSentence=10>It's garbage for people that aren't computer say and are pulled in by its looks.</sentence>
